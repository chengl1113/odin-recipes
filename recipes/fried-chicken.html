        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Fried chicken has been described as being "crunchy" and "juicy", as well as "crispy". The dish has also been called "spicy" and "salty". Occasionally, fried chicken is also topped with chili like paprika, or hot sauce to give it a spicy taste.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (3 pound) frying chicken, cut up</li>
            <li>2 cups buttermilk</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon poultry seasoning</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon celery seeds</li>
            <li>Vegetable oil for deep-frying</li>
            <li>2 cups Kikkoman Tempura Batter Mix</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Wash chicken and pat dry. In a large bowl, stir together buttermilk, garlic powder, onion powder, poultry seasoning and celery seeds. Place chicken in buttermilk mixture and refrigerate at least 8 hours or overnight.</li>
            <li>In a large frying pan or wok, heat oil to 325 degrees F. Drain chicken in a colander to remove excess buttermilk. Place tempura batter mix in a large paper bag; add chicken. Close top and gently shake bag to coat chicken with tempura batter mix. Remove chicken and fry, turning pieces over after 3 minutes. Continue to fry, turning occasionally, until browned on all sides.</li>
